<div class="headings"> About U </div>

<p> Today I am here reading this page because I have love and concern towards society. I always thought of helping others and thought of doing something for the society. But time, my responsibilities and living conditions never permitted me. There was always a voice in my mind stating that I can help someone only after once I get well settled and once I am done with my responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
Months and seasons went away but nothing got materialized and still I have a burning desire in my heart to help others. Yes the time has come for me to see the change in the society and I have that power within me to bring change in the society. It’s the right time for me to choose the path of social service that my heart always wanted to do.
</p>

<p>
 Everyone in this world will have responsibilities towards his family, his career and wishes to lead better life. In this reiterative circle I am not getting time to give my attention towards social welfare though I have desire to do service and whenever I move forward towards helping this society there was always my responsibilities knocking my door and hence I end up in that reiterative cycle, there by closing the doors of my heart to do social service.
</p>
<p><b> Now the question is can I come out of this reiterative cycle without actually forgetting my responsibilities towards my family, my career and participate in social service? </b> <br />

<div style="background-color:#CCC; font-size:13px;"  >   The answer for this question is YES. Here is the platform for you guys with great flexibility through which you can participate in social service and as well you can justify your responsibilities. All you need to do is spend your valuable time of 4 hours a month. </div>

  
  <b> <br />

                                Joy of Sharing Society  is a non-government organization(NGO) working for underprivileged children and takes charge in other social cause events. We are based in Hyderabad with a group of individuals working in different MNC, who has the passion and determination to work for the society apart from their personal life. Establishing this NGO serves purposes, firstly our mission to change lives of such children - by providing them with long-term care. This includes basic needs, education and healthcare, skills, personality development necessary to transform them into responsible citizens. Secondly, to provide such a platform where every individual who has a zeal to do something for the society but certain situations doesn't make them to do so. Every one has a determination to work, donate or get involved in the social cause but at the same time we think if whatever we are doing is going to the correct hands? 

We in JOSH team provides such a platform to the people to get involved in the social cause in any way they want and also we see that the every little thing is reaching to the right hands.
